# Getting Started!

## Uninstalling Older Versions

While this step may seem like a pain now, having only one version of the software allows you to have an easier time managing the software development environment and save time in the long run, so that you can focus on programming and testing your code. 

You should be uninstalling older versions of the FRC Game Tools, FRC Radio Configuration Utility, and other third party applications such as the CTRE Phoenix Tuner. 

## Installing FRC Software

{% hint style="info" %}
Make sure to install the software on at least two computers, so that you always have a backup computer
{% endhint %}

There are two ways of installing the FRC Software: offline and online. I prefer the offline installation because it's easier to download all the necessary software into a single flash drive, which can be used to install software for each of the programming computers. However, either method of installation is correct. Make sure to read through the getting started and software setup guides because they contain important information about where to find the software and steps to install them. **Use admin when installing any software, otherwise, you will run into problems.**

## Installing Third Party Software

Third Party Software includes any tools/firmware/APIs from CTRE, REV Robotics, Kauai Labs. I would suggest putting all the firmware for the motor controls in a folder on the Desktop labeled "firmware".

* CTRE: Download the Phoenix Tuner and the most recent firmware for Talon SRXs and/or Falcon 500s
* REV Robotics: Download the SPARK MAX Client Application \(the bane of my existence\) and the most recent firmware for the Spark Max 

After installing all the firmware and software for the motor controls, you should now be ready to start setting up the code! Woo hoo!

Make sure to label/record which laptops have the necessary software! Also, check to make sure the laptops have admin rights.
