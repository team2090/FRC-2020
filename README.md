Hi, this is Jason Tay \(Class of 2020\) and here is our FRC 2020 documentation and notes. In this mini guide will be everything I know about programming and general debugging tips for FRC Robotics. Feel free to edit and use this guide in whatever way is most useful for you. Please note that information in this guide may be outdated or contain slight inaccuracies \(hopefully not\), so please refer to updated official guides when in doubt to get the most accurate information. **This is just a general guide, but you should always go to** [**https://docs.wpilib.org**](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/wpilib-overview/index.html) **since the library and setup processes are slightly different every year.** Thank you and have fun programming \(you can do it\)!
