Hi, this is Jason Tay \(Class of 2020\) and here is our FRC 2020 documentation and notes. In this mini guide will be everything I know about programming and general debugging tips for FRC Robotics. Feel free to edit and use this guide in whatever way is most useful for you. Please note that information in this guide may be outdated or contain slight inaccuracies \(hopefully not\), so please refer to updated official guides when in doubt to get the most accurate information. **This is just a general guide, but you should always go to** [**https://docs.wpilib.org**](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/wpilib-overview/index.html) **since the library and setup processes are slightly different every year.** Don't feel discouraged if you get stuck on something while programming, that's natural and happens often. Thank you and have fun programming! 

If you are viewing this from our Github repository, this guide can be found [here](https://programmers2090.gitbook.io/2090-frc-programming-bible/). This is still a WIP!

{% hint style="warning" %}
This guide was written in 2021 \(I was going to write it in 2020, but procrastinated\), which means that I'm writing about what I recall from programming in 2020/2019. So take what you read with a grain \(or many grains\) of salt. Always refer to official guides if you're unclear about anything.
